Everyone roll will save to see if the group can resist peer pressure. If even one group member rolls below 15, the group as a whole feels the same sense of obligation due to the camaraderie of travellers.\n\n                If the group manages to roll above 15, Ar'koth says, \"I guess my usual tactics aren't going to work. Fine, I'll just say it...\"\n\n                If the group has already drank or been pressured to drink, Ar'koth says, \"I'll be right back...\" He returns with another pitcher of ale.

Entering the compound wearing disguises is an option.\n\n                    Approaching the walls, the party is unable to scale them without a climber's kit or spider climb spell. The party must make a dexterity or stealth check to remain hidden from the archers. Should any party member fail, all three archers will immediately start attack rolls at the party.

If the party rolls under 8, he will attack, and two of the three archers on the walls will be able to get clear shots at the group. \n\n                    After the party defeats the archers atop the wall, the guard below will remain clueless about any commotion above, and they can safely enter the compound through a guard corridor connecting from the wall to the main building. \n\n                    After the party bluffs or defeats the door guard, they can either make dexterity checks to dodge the archers' attacks or walk without a care in the world across the grounds to the main building. \n                    Inside, a portly man sits on a high-backed chair in front of a table adorned with indulgent meats.

After the Great Wars had faded into obscurity, thousands of soldiers on both sides of the war were left without a livelihood, without a purpose. Some wandered the vast sands making their way with opportunistic lawlessness, and others became sell swords.\n\n                The most central oasis within the sands became a natural junction, a resting place. As these former soldiers gathered, so too did merchants and service workers. Tattered opposing uniforms of red and blue lost meaning, and over time, a new uniform of purple and black emerged in the shanty town. \n\n                Tents became mud huts, which evolved into brick and mortar buildings that supported overhead aqueducts stemming from the oasis. The mercenaries who built Seratine managed to convert blood to riches, and it didn't matter where this blood came from, so long as it continued to flow and nourish the city.\n\n                A group of adventurers stand at the city's center on rough stonework among a purple crowd.

There's smirks and arrogant looks directed at your party.\n\n                In front of the crowd is an elevated podium, and a formidable looking woman effortlessly climbs the waist height sheer while wearing plated armour. It's an impressive and casual display of strength that doesn't go unnoticed. The crowd begins to cheer and sound a rhythm by smashing weapons against shields and armour. This beat starts slow and becomes faster as she approaches the center of the podium before it abruptly stops, and the crowd goes dead silent.\n\n                \"Economic growth has been uncharacteristically slow this month…\" she begins, \"and I think I know why. I think too many of you are taking the easy contracts that don't pay as well.\" The crowd erupts in indignant exclamations. \n\n                \"I know,\" she says, \"it's not fair to blame all of you when it's likely only a handful not pulling their weight, which is why I'm opening recruitment again.\" \n\n                There's loud boos from the crowd, and a man standing at the edge of the congregation yells, \"We don't need help from any outsiders!\" The crowd responds by screaming in agreement and cheering.\n\n                The woman waits with a serene expression until the outcries calm. \"Needless to say, new initiates will earn the uniform, just like all of you, and if you think I'm going to make this easy, think again.\" There's silence as if she knew what their objections were likely to be well in advance.\n                Your party is suddenly aware she's looking directly at your group and so is every other set of eyes.
